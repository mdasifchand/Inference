# Inference

- Resnet50 architecture is used, the main reason is it democratized the usage of skip connections with residual connections which helped DL networks to do deeper and at the same time improve efficiency. 

- For more details read the research paper. ResNet50 here performs classifications in real-time with minimal latency. The program is designed to run AI enabled embedded automotive hardware.
