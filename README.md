# Inference

- Resnet50 architecture is used, reason it democratized the usage of skip connections with residual connections which helped DL networks to do deeper and at the same improve efficiency. 

- For more details read the research paper. ResNet50 here performs classifications in real-time with minimal latency. The program is designed to run embedded automotive hardware.
